/*1. What does n & (n - 1) check?
It checks whether n has only one bit set. This is true only for powers of 2.

2. Why do we check n > 0?
Because 0 and negative numbers are not powers of 2, but the expression 0 & (-1) also gives 0, which is misleading. So we ensure n is positive.

3. What is the time complexity of this method?
It's O(1), since it's a direct mathematical check using bitwise operation.*/
